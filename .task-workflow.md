# Task Workflow (OODA Loop)

## Commands
```bash
just ooda              # Run: Observe → Orient → Decide → Act
just tasks-status      # Show counts
just task-done T006    # Mark complete
just task-add T013 develop "New task" rust-expert '["T006"]'
just lfmf rust "lesson"         # b00t lesson learned
just advice rust "topic"        # b00t retrieve advice
```

## Auto-Processing
- pm2 runs OODA loop every 5 minutes
- Batches up to 3 parallel tasks
- Delegates to agents via `/tmp/agent_tasks/`

## Task Format (JSONL)
```json
{"id":"T006","phase":"develop","status":"pending","task":"Implement Customer crate","deps":["T003"],"agent":"rust-expert"}
```

Phases: research → develop → test → evaluate (TRIZ)
Storage: `tasks.jsonl` (durable, efficient)
